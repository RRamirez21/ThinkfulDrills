If both slogans can meet this requirement, continue with the slogan that has the higher conversion rate. If both slogans have the same conversion rate or if the conversation rate among droids decreases in the three months, but by less than one standard deviation, observe for three more months before deciding. If the conversation rates for both slogans remain the same, allow the Sith Lords to vote on which they prefer. If the conversation rate continues to decrease in those three months, identify a new slogan."
